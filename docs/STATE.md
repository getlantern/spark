## Current position
- Milestone: **M5 — UDP path. SESSION 1 DONE 2026-06-11** (per-datagram framing codec +
  NAT association table, both standalone and unit-tested). TCP path (M2→M4) is code-complete.
  **Session 2 (needs root):** enable the netstack UDP socket, drive the read/reply
  orchestration in `proxy/udp.rs`, pass the live DNS/echo gate.
- Last gate passed: **M0** 2026-06-10; **M1**/**M2-s1** code green 2026-06-10 (live gates
  pending root); **M3a**+**M3b**+**M4 code** green 2026-06-11; **M5 session 1** green
  2026-06-11 — `transport::tcp_tunnel::udp` datagram framing (round-trip IPv4/IPv6/domain,
  empty payload, truncation, oversize) + `proxy::udp::NatTable` (create/reuse, idle eviction
  with injected `now`, remove).
- Tree status: **green** — `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings` / `fmt
  --check` clean; `cargo test -p spark-core` = **25 unit + 2 integration passed**;
  `netstack_smoke` prints `NETSTACK OK`; release `spark` **~1.05 MB** (unchanged — UDP code
  is lib-only until session 2 wires it into the binary).

## Next chunk (exactly what the next session should do)
Two independent tracks — pick by whether a privileged box is available:

**(A) M5 session 2 — UDP orchestration + live gate (needs root).** Session 1 built the
framing (`transport::tcp_tunnel::udp`) and the table (`proxy::udp::NatTable`). Remaining:
1. Enable the netstack UDP socket: `SmoltcpNetstack` currently builds with
   `enable_udp(false)`; flip to `true` and surface the `UdpSocket` (it `split()`s into a
   `ReadHalf: Stream<Item=UdpMsg>` and `WriteHalf: Sink<UdpMsg>`). Extend the `Netstack`
   trait with a UDP surface (deferred since M2). **Orientation (verified, vendored
   src/udp.rs):** `UdpMsg = (payload, local, remote)` is INVERTED like TCP — `local` =
   client source, `remote` = original destination. A reply is written as
   `(reply_payload, original_dst, client_src)`.
2. `proxy/udp.rs` read loop: per datagram, `NatTable::get_or_insert_with` an association
   (dials the target via the `Transport` / a per-flow UDP socket to the server) and spawns a
   reply pump writing back to the `WriteHalf`. Frame datagrams with `tcp_tunnel::udp`.
   Periodically `evict_expired(Instant::now())` and drop the returned associations.
3. *Gate:* a DNS query (UDP/53) and a UDP echo both round-trip through the tunnel; idle
   associations are reclaimed. DNS strategy = proxy-through-tunnel; idle timeout = 60s
   (`DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT`).

**(B) Root-gated live verification (human), do when a privileged window opens:**
- **M4 live gate** — stand up a tunnel server, run `spark --server <addr>` with a route into
  the TUN, `curl --interface tun0 https://1.1.1.1`; verify server-side it saw the connection.
  macOS works here (the dial targets the server, so no M2 loop hazard).
- **M2 live curl gate** — `spark` (no `--server`), README "M2 plain-TCP-forwarder gate"
  (Linux: bring up `tun0`, loosen `rp_filter`, `curl -v --interface tun0 https://1.1.1.1`).
  Loop hazard: do NOT route the target into the tun; `--interface` binds only the client.
- **M1 live ping gate** — see Blockers.
- Record routing cmds + poll/latency in the Decisions log and tick M1/M2/M4 as they pass.

## Blockers / waiting on human
- **M1 live gate (pending, needs root):** run and confirm `ping` replies, then mark M1
  fully passed. macOS: `sudo RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/spark --addr 10.0.0.1
  --prefix 24`, note the assigned `utunN` in the log, then `ping 10.0.0.2` (ping a *peer*
  in the subnet, not 10.0.0.1 which the host answers locally). Linux: same with
  `--name tun0`. Steps are in README "M1 ICMP-echo gate". This box has **no passwordless
  sudo**, so the agent cannot run it.
- Upcoming (not blocking yet): a simple TCP relay test server needed at **M3** (PLAN
  Appendix B); if a transport TLS-wraps its relay, confirm the `rustls` client config
  (verification + roots) before trusting it.

## Verified API facts (RE-CONFIRMED at M0 on rustc 1.93.1 against vendored 0.2.2 source — trust)
- netstack-smoltcp **0.2.2** vendored at `vendor/netstack-smoltcp/` (src copied from the
  crates.io 0.2.2 tarball via `static.crates.io`; lib-only manifest; `smoltcp` pinned `=0.12.0`).
- `StackBuilder::default()` is fluent — `.enable_tcp(bool).enable_udp(bool).enable_icmp(bool)
  .stack_buffer_size(n).tcp_buffer_size(n).udp_buffer_size(n).mtu(n).build()` →
  `io::Result<(Stack, Option<Runner>, Option<UdpSocket>, Option<TcpListener>)>`.
  (Confirmed: `src/stack.rs:103` `build()` returns exactly that tuple; `.mtu()` at `src/stack.rs:97`.)
  Builder defaults: stack_buffer 1024, udp 512, tcp 512, **mtu 1504** (1500 + 4 VLAN).
- `enable_icmp(true)` requires `enable_tcp(true)` — builder returns `InvalidInput "ICMP
  requires TCP"` otherwise (`src/stack.rs:129`). ICMP echo is serviced by the TCP Interface.
- `Runner`, if present, must be `tokio::spawn`'d (drives the smoltcp poll loop).
- `Stack: Stream<Item = std::io::Result<AnyIpPktFrame>>` + `Sink<AnyIpPktFrame, Error =
  io::Error>` (`src/stack.rs:203,216`). Note the **`io::Result` wrapper on the stream item** —
  the bridge does `while let Some(Ok(pkt)) = stream.next().await`. `stack.split()` gives the
  two halves. `AnyIpPktFrame = Vec<u8>` (`src/packet.rs:5`).
- `TcpListener: Stream<Item = (TcpStream, SocketAddr, SocketAddr)>` =
  `(stream, local_addr, remote_addr)` (`src/tcp.rs:414`). **CORRECTION (M2, verified
  against the construction site `src/tcp.rs:118,132-133,165` where the socket `listen`s
  on `dst_addr`):** netstack-smoltcp **inverts** the usual server-socket naming. The 2nd
  tuple element (`local_addr` = `TcpStream::local_addr()` = the `src_addr` field) is the
  **app's source** (`packet.src_addr`); the 3rd element (`remote_addr` = `dst_addr` field)
  is the **original destination** (`packet.dst_addr`) — the upstream the app dialed.
  **Dial the 3rd element.** The prior M0 note claimed `local_addr` was the original
  destination — that was inferred from the never-fired smoke example and is WRONG; the
  smoke example's variable name has been corrected. `TcpStream: tokio AsyncRead +
  AsyncWrite` (`src/tcp.rs:464,501`) and is `Unpin` (fields: 2×SocketAddr + 2 Arc-style
  shared handles) → `copy_bidirectional` works directly (`&mut *boxed` satisfies its
  `?Sized` bound; compiled + unit-tested at M2).
- `.mtu()` exists in 0.2.x but **not** 0.1.x — do not assume builder methods across versions.
- Toolchain floor: `smoltcp 0.12` needs rustc ≥1.80; `tun-rs` 2.8.x pulls an edition-2024
  dep → effective MSRV **≥ 1.85**. Dev box ran rustc **1.93.1** (active `stable`); MSRV floor
  enforced via `rust-version = "1.85"` in every manifest, not by pinning the toolchain.

### tun-rs (VERIFIED at M1 against the 2.8.5 source — trust)
- `tun_rs::DeviceBuilder::new().ipv4(addr, prefix_or_mask, dst: Option<IPv4>).ipv6(addr,
  prefix).name(S: Into<String>).mtu(u16).build_async() -> io::Result<AsyncDevice>`
  (`src/builder.rs:902,962,980,906,917,1355`). `.ipv4` mask arg is generic `ToIpv4Netmask`;
  a `u8` prefix works (we pass `24`). `build_sync()` also exists.
- `AsyncDevice::recv(&self, &mut [u8]).await -> io::Result<usize>` and `send(&self, &[u8])
  .await -> io::Result<usize>` (inherent; `&self` → shareable via `Arc`)
  (`src/async_device/unix|macos|windows/mod.rs`). `try_recv`/`try_send` exist too.
- `AsyncDevice: Deref<Target = DeviceImpl>`, so `dev.name() -> io::Result<String>` and
  `dev.mtu() -> io::Result<u16>` (and `addresses()`) work via auto-deref
  (`src/async_device/*/mod.rs` Deref; `src/platform/macos/device.rs:182,230`).
- **macOS normalizes utun frames to raw IP** — no 4-byte AF prefix to strip; the parser
  keys on `buf[0] >> 4` on every platform (matches tun-rs's own cross-platform example).
- Framed bridge (for M2): `tun_rs::async_framed::{DeviceFramed, BytesCodec}` behind the
  `async_framed` feature; `DeviceFramed::new(dev, BytesCodec::new())` is a `Stream<Item=
  io::Result<BytesMut>>` + `Sink<BytesMut>`. We added only the `async` feature at M1.

## Baseline binary size
- **M4:** `target/release/spark` = **1,073,584 bytes (~1.05 MB)**, stripped Mach-O arm64.
  +~16 KB over M2 — the transport (Transport trait + TunnelClient + DirectTransport) is now
  linked into the binary (M3's transport was lib-only, dead-code-eliminated until M4 wired
  it in). Budget <3 MB — still comfortable.
- **M2:** `target/release/spark` = **1,057,008 bytes (~1.03 MB)**, stripped Mach-O arm64.
  +~133 KB over M1 — adds the vendored netstack-smoltcp + smoltcp + async-trait. Budget:
  <3 MB stripped — still comfortable headroom.
- **M1:** 923,344 bytes (~902 KB) — links tun-rs + tokio(full) + clap + tracing-subscriber.
  (M0 was ~280 KB — empty CLI.)

## Decisions log (append-only)
- 2026-06-11 (M5 s1): **UDP-over-tunnel framing + NAT table; DNS = proxy-through-tunnel;
  idle timeout = 60s.** Datagram framing (`transport/tcp_tunnel/udp.rs`):
  `[Address][LEN(u16,be)][payload]` — reuses the M3a `Address` codec, length-prefixed so it
  survives a stream (TCP/TLS) that erases datagram boundaries; `parse` returns
  `(Address, &payload, consumed)` and distinguishes `Incomplete` (truncated) from malformed,
  like the TCP header. NAT table (`proxy/udp.rs`): generic `NatTable<V>` keyed by
  `(client_src, original_dst)`, `now`-injected for deterministic eviction tests,
  `evict_expired` returns reclaimed values so the orchestration can close per-flow sockets.
  `DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT = 60s` (DNS is short-lived; covers a slow resolver without stranding
  state). DNS strategy = **proxy-through-tunnel** (no special-casing :53 — it rides the UDP
  path like any datagram), per the standing decision. Netstack UDP socket left disabled
  until session 2 (enabling it without draining `ReadHalf` would back-pressure the stack).
- 2026-06-11 (M4): **`Transport` trait is the direct/tunnel seam; `dial` takes `SocketAddr`.**
  `core/src/transport/mod.rs`: `#[async_trait] trait Transport: Send + Sync { async fn
  dial(&self, target: SocketAddr) -> io::Result<BoxedStream> }`. `DirectTransport` (M2
  behavior) and `TunnelClient` both impl it; the forwarder takes `Arc<dyn Transport>` and is
  identical for both. `dial` takes `SocketAddr` (what the netstack surfaces), not the richer
  `Address`, to decouple the trait from the tunnel header type — the tunnel impl wraps it as
  `Address::Ip` internally. `TunnelClient` keeps an inherent `dial(Address)` (domain-capable,
  used by M3b tests); the trait method delegates to it (the `Address` arg disambiguates the
  overload). **Moved `AsyncReadWrite` + added `BoxedStream` alias to the crate root** (`lib.rs`)
  so netstack flows and transport streams share one boxed type. CLI selects transport with
  `--server <addr>` (tunnel) vs absent (direct). Live gate (curl through a real server) is
  root+server-gated and deferred.
- 2026-06-11 (M3b): **Header sent eagerly in `dial`; `TunnelStream` is a transparent
  pass-through.** `TunnelClient::dial(target)` opens TCP to the server, `write_all`s the
  encoded header, then returns `TunnelStream<TcpStream>` which just delegates
  `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` to the inner connection. (Lazily coalescing the header into the
  first `poll_write` saves a syscall but adds partial-write state — deferred as an
  optimization; the gate is a correctness echo.) Server-side header recovery lives in
  `stream::read_header` (partial-read buffering: loop `Address::parse`, treat `Incomplete`
  as read-more, map permanent errors → `InvalidData`, mid-header EOF → `UnexpectedEof`); it
  returns `(Address, leftover_payload_bytes)` so a relay forwards bytes read past the header.
  Integration test uses an in-test relay (Appendix B opt 1); the relay tries all resolved
  candidate addresses (localhost → ::1 then 127.0.0.1) to stay order-independent. No TLS yet.
- 2026-06-11 (M3a): **Tunnel header = SOCKS5 address grammar (RFC 1928 §4), no SOCKS
  framing.** `ATYP(1) | ADDR | PORT(2, big-endian)`, ATYP 1=IPv4 / 3=domain(len-prefixed) /
  4=IPv6. Chosen because it's compact, self-delimiting, and off-the-shelf relays already
  speak it. `Address` enum = `Ip(SocketAddr)` (covers v4+v6) | `Domain{host,port}` (domain
  validated non-empty + ≤255 at construction via `Address::domain`, so `encode` is
  infallible). `parse` returns `(Address, consumed_len)` and distinguishes
  `HeaderError::Incomplete` (truncated → caller reads more; M3b's buffering retry signal)
  from permanent errors (`UnknownAtyp`/`EmptyDomain`/`InvalidDomain`). Lives in
  `core/src/transport/tcp_tunnel/header.rs`; the `Transport` trait is deferred to M4.
- 2026-06-10 (M2): **Original-destination address fix.** netstack-smoltcp inverts the usual
  server-socket naming: the `TcpListener` tuple's **3rd** element (`remote_addr`) is the
  original destination to dial, not the 2nd. Verified at the construction site
  (`vendor/.../src/tcp.rs:118,132-133,165`, socket `listen`s on `dst_addr`). Corrected the
  STATE verified-facts line and the (never-fired, hence latently-wrong) smoke-example label.
- 2026-06-10 (M2): **Bridge = raw `recv`/`send` loop, not `DeviceFramed`.** Kept the M1
  `Tun::recv`/`send` surface (shared via `Arc<Tun>`, both take `&self`) over adding the
  `tun-rs` `async_framed` feature — fewer moving parts and lower API risk. The stack `Sink`
  item is owned `Vec<u8>` (`AnyIpPktFrame`), so the TUN→stack direction reads into a fresh
  `vec![0u8; mtu]` and `truncate`s — one alloc, zero copy (the alloc is forced by the
  vendored sink signature; eliminating it means patching the vendor to take `BytesMut`).
- 2026-06-10 (M2): Stack built `enable_tcp(true).enable_udp(false).enable_icmp(true)`,
  `.mtu(tun.mtu())`. ICMP rides the TCP interface for free and keeps the M1 ping sanity
  check; UDP deferred to M5. `SmoltcpNetstack` owns the runner + both bridge tasks as
  `JoinHandle`s and aborts them on `Drop` (no orphaned tasks).
- 2026-06-10 (M2): Added `async-trait` (pre-approved in CLAUDE.md for trait objects) for the
  `Netstack` trait. `TcpFlow.stream: Box<dyn AsyncReadWrite + Unpin + Send>`; forwarder
  passes `&mut *stream` to `copy_bidirectional` (its `?Sized` bound accepts the trait object,
  which auto-implements the `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` supertraits).
- 2026-06-10 (M2): **M2 macOS curl gate deferred to M4.** Direct dial + routing the target
  into the tun loops on macOS (no `SO_BINDTODEVICE`); the loop vanishes at M4 when spark
  dials a tunnel server at a different address. Linux gate (per-socket bind) is the M2 check.
- 2026-06-10 (M0): Vendored `netstack-smoltcp` **0.2.2** by copying the published crates.io
  0.2.2 source (via `static.crates.io`) into `vendor/netstack-smoltcp/`, rewritten to a
  lib-only manifest (examples/tests/dev-deps dropped) with `smoltcp` pinned to `=0.12.0`.
  Excluded from `[workspace.members]` (`exclude` in root manifest) so its dev-deps don't
  enter our lock; depended on by `path` via `[workspace.dependencies]`.
- 2026-06-10 (M0): Workspace members = `core` (`spark-core`), `cli` (`spark-cli`, bin
  `spark`), `ipc` (`spark-ipc`, empty stub), `service` (`spark-service`, empty stub).
  `netstack-spike` and `circ-tool` also `exclude`d. Release profile (opt-level=z, lto=fat,
  cu=1, strip, panic=abort) lives in the **root** manifest (profiles only apply from root).
- 2026-06-10 (M0): `rust-toolchain.toml` uses `channel = "stable"` (not a hard pin); MSRV
  floor ≥1.85 enforced by `rust-version` in each manifest. Active stable on dev box = 1.93.1.
- 2026-06-10 (M1): **Hand-rolled** the IP parser + ICMP echo logic (`core/src/packet/`)
  instead of pulling `pnet_packet` (what the tun-rs example uses) — a TUN in IP mode never
  sees L2/ARP, and keeping it dep-free protects the size budget. ~120 lines, unit-tested
  (RFC-1071 checksum; v4 IP+ICMP and v6 ICMPv6 pseudo-header).
- 2026-06-10 (M1): **Log hygiene enforced from M1, not deferred to M6.** The driver logs
  `proto`+`len` at `info`; src/dst addresses only at `debug` (`--debug` or `RUST_LOG=debug`).
  Satisfies M1's "logs show parsed packets" without leaking destinations by default.
- 2026-06-10 (M1): tun-rs added with the `async` feature only (tokio AsyncDevice, raw
  recv/send loop). `async_framed` deferred to M2 when the netstack bridge needs it.
- Language/stack: Rust + tokio + rustls(ring) + ring; netstack = **vendored** netstack-smoltcp
  over smoltcp; TUN = tun-rs (desktop). Rationale in CLAUDE.md (locked stack).
- MSRV ≥ 1.85 (toolchain floor above).
- Process model: privileged tunnel process + unprivileged client; **data plane in-process**,
  control-plane IPC only (`ipc/` crate, serde+postcard, length-prefixed, versioned handshake).
- Kill-switch: **fail open** (restore direct routing on crash, surfaced loudly) with a
  per-profile fail-closed override. (process-architecture-and-ipc.md §5.)
- DNS strategy default: **proxy-through-tunnel** (revisit at M5 if needed).
- FFI (mobile): **uniffi-rs** preferred (confirm at M10).
- Config format: TOML (alternate import formats deferred).
